# Alert Types Explained

This document explains **all alert types** generated by the ESP32 Crypto Alert Monitor.
Alerts are designed to signal **contextual market situations**, not buy/sell commands.

---

## General principles
- Alerts are **event-based**, not continuous
- Cooldowns prevent repeated notifications
- Most alerts depend on **relative movement**, not absolute price
- Alerts gain meaning when combined (confluence)

---

**Purpose:** Detect sudden price jumps or drops.

**Triggered when:**
- Absolute 1-minute return exceeds the configured threshold

**Typical use:**

**Risk:** High noise if threshold is too low

---

## 📈 5-Minute Move Alert
**Purpose:** Confirm that a spike develops into a short move.

**Triggered when:**

## 📦 Compression Alert
**Purpose:** Detect market contraction.

**Triggered when:**

**Interpretation:**

---

## 🎯 Anchor Context Alert
**Purpose:** Alert when price behavior becomes inconsistent with anchor.

**Triggered when:**
- Anchor lies outside current 2h range by margin

**Use case:**

- Risk recalibration

---

## 💰 Take Profit Alert
**Purpose:** Signal favorable movement from anchor.

**Triggered when:**

## Alert philosophy
Alerts are **contextual signals**, not instructions.

The most reliable situations occur when:
- Multiple alerts align
- Trend, volatility, and timeframe agree

Think in **clusters**, not isolated alerts.
