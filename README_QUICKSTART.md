# ESP32 Crypto Alert – Quick Start

## What do I need?
- ESP32 with display (CYD recommended)
- WiFi connection
- ntfy.sh account (or public topic)

---

## Steps
1. Flash the firmware
2. Power on the device
3. Connect it to WiFi
4. Open the web interface
5. Set:
   - Binance symbol (e.g. BTCEUR)
   - Anchor price
   - Alert thresholds
6. Save settings

---

## First tips
- Start with default thresholds
- Set your anchor to a meaningful price
- Enable only a few alerts at first
- Observe behavior before tightening settings

---

## Common mistakes
- Setting thresholds too low → alert spam
- Forgetting cooldowns
- Treating alerts as buy/sell commands

This system is about **context, not commands**.
